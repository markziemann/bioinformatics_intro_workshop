## What is R and why use it?

A statistical computing and data visualisation language, derived from an earlier
language called S.


## What a typical workflow looks like

* Comments

* Load libraries

* Read data

* Cleaning

* Analysis

* Data visualisation

* Save files

* Execute

This week, our goal is to learn:

* how to work with R on the command line and in RStudio on the HPC

* about different data structures in R

* how to do basic math in R

## Setting up an interactive R session on the HPC

If you are connected to the Burnet network, visit the HPC documentation [here](http://burnethpcdocs.domain.internal.burnet.edu.au/getting-started).

Create a new tmux session which will be persistent.
Then make an interactive SLURM session where you can run some analysis.
You can customise the threads, memory and time to your needs.

```
tmux new -s mysession

srun -p interactive --pty --time=180 --threads=2 --mem=8G bash -i
```

Then run an example command.
Here we are grabbing some random data and compressing it with pigz, which is a
parallel compression tool.
This will use all available CPU threads.

```
head -1000 /dev/random | pigz -p2 > /dev/null
```

If you want to run some scripts, you will likely need to load modules.
This is a good way to maintain parallel version of languages like R.
Use the following commands to show the available modules.

```
module avail

module spider
```

Try loading R version 4.3.2.

```
module load R/4.3.2
```

Now run R and check the version and exit.

```
R
sessionInfo()
q()
```

Exit interactive sessions with `exit`.

Non interactive jobs can be scheduled using SLURM, using the [HPC docs](http://burnethpcdocs.domain.internal.burnet.edu.au/slurm) as a guide.

## RStudio session

Rstudio offers some benefits due to its interactive and graphical nature.

```
sbatch --time=180 --threads=2 --mem=8G  /software/jobs/rstudio_4.4.job
```

It will say "Submitted batch job 1234" (the number will be different),
and will create a file in the current working directory called rstudio.job.1234.
List the contents with `ls` to confirm that the file was created,
then type `cat rstudio.job.1234` to read the instructions to connect.

Let's get to know the Rstudio interface a bit better.
It consists of a menu bar at the top of the browser window and four panels below:

| Menu Bar |
|:----:|:----:|
| Top left: Script (type and save your scripts here)   | Top right: Global Environment (R data objects you can work with) |
| Bottom left: Console (commands are executed here)  |  Bottom right: Files, Plots and help pages  |

If you cannot see the Script panel, click "New Script" on the menu bar and it should appear.

Let’s watch a video together to learn the basics of the Rstudio environment.

alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="480" height="360" border="10" /></a>

## Intro to R part 1

Here we will begin with simpler data structures and commands.

### Arithmetic

Open up your Rstudio and try these commands by typing in the script panel and hitting the “Run” button or Ctrl+Enter, observing the output.

We'll start with some arithmetic.

```{r,math1}

1+2
10000^2
sqrt(64)

```

Notice that as you start typing commands like `sqrt` that Rstudio will give you suggestions, you can use the tab key to autocomplete.

### Working with variables

Use the `<-` back arrow or `=` to define variables.

```{r,math2}

s <- sqrt(64)
s

a <- 2
b <- 5
c <- a*b
c

```

### Vectors

We can also do operations on vectors of numbers.

Vectors are specified with c-brackets like this `c(1,2,3)`

```{r,math3}

c(1,2,3)
sum(c(1,10,100))
mean(c(1,10,100))
median(c(1,10,100))
max(c(1,10,100))
min(c(1,10,100))

```

### Saving variables

To make things easier to read and write, we can save the vector as a variable `a`.
Then we can work on `a`.

We use the `<-` to save objects in R, but `=` also works.

`length ` tells us the number of elements in the vector which is very useful.

```{r,math4}

a <- c(1,10,100)
a
2*a
a+1
sum(a)
mean(a)
median(a)
sd(a)
var(a)
length(a)

```

### R object types

Whenever we are using an R object we should check exactly what sort of object it is.
This is the most common type of error you will encounter.

We use the `str()` command to check the structure.
Other commands we can use to investigate the data structure include `class()` and `typeof()`

The colon `:` can be used to specify a series or range.
For example 1:5 for numbers 1 to 5.

Note the different object types here:

A is a Numerical vector

B is Numerical vector (series)

C is a named numerical vector

D is a character string

E is a character vector

F is a named character vector

```{r,math5}

A <- c(1,10,100)
A
str(A)
class(A)
typeof(A)

B <- 1:10
B
str(B)
class(B)
typeof(B)

C <- c("prime1"=2, "prime2"=3, "prime3"=5, "prime4"=7)
C
str(C)
class(C)
typeof(C)

D <- "x1"
D
str(D)
class(D)
typeof(D)

E <- c("x1", "y2", "z3")
E
str(E)
names(E) <- c("code1","code2","code3")
E
str(E)
class(E)
typeof(E)

```

Note how the names can be added during or after the vector is defined.

### Factors

Factors are an entirely different type of data in R.
They are represented as non numeric categories, but are stored internally as numerical data.
Typically factors are used in R for categorical data like biological sex.
Here the example is an unordered category.

```{r,factors1}

x <- factor(c("single", "married", "married", "single","defacto","widowed"))
x
str(x)
levels(x)

```

But it is possible to have ordered factors as well.

Take this survey result about a product as an example, where respondents rate the food at a restaurant between very poor and very good.
These responses have a natural order, so it makes sense to treat these as ordered factors.

```{r,factors2}

y <- c("good", "very good", "fair", "poor","good")
str(y)
yy <- factor(y, levels = c("very poor","poor","fair","good","very good"),ordered = TRUE)
yy
str(yy)
levels(yy)

```

### Logicals

R also uses `TRUE/FALSE` a lot, as a data type as well as an option when executing commands.

It is also possible to have vectors of logical values.

```{r,logicals}

myvariable1 <- 0
as.logical(myvariable1)

myvariable2 <- 1
as.logical(myvariable2)

vals <- c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0)
vals
str(vals)
as.logical(vals)

```

### Subsetting vectors

Next, we would like to subset vectors.
To do this, we use square brackets and inside the square bracket we indicate which values we want, using 1 for the first and 2 for second and so on.

See how it is possible to get the last and second last elements.

We can subset vectors, run arithmetic operations and save the results to a new variable in a single line.

```{r,vec_subset}

a <- c(2:22,98,124,3002)
length(a)
a[2]
a[3:4]
a[c(1,3)]
a[length(a)]
a[(length(a)-1)]

x <- a[10:(length(a)-1)] * 2
x

```

### Coersing R data into different types

As shown above with commands like `factor` and `as.logical`, it is possible to convert objects into different types.

Here are some further examples.

Note that some conversions don't make sense, which can cause errors in your analysis.

```{r,conv1}

a <- c(1.9,2.7,3.3,5.1,9.9,0)
a
as.integer(a)
as.character(a)
as.logical(a)
as.factor(a)

b <- c("abc","def","ghi","jkl")
b
as.numeric(b)
as.logical(b)
as.integer(b)
my_factor <- as.factor(b)
as.numeric(my_factor)

```

### Creating random and semi random data

This is used a lot in statistics and probability as well as simulation analysis.

```{r,sample1}

nums <- 1:5
sample(x = nums, size = 3)
sample(x = nums, size = 5)
sample(x = nums ,size = 10, replace = TRUE)

```

We can also sample from distributions.
Here we are sampling 5 numbers from a normal distribution around a median of 10 and standard deviation of 2

```{r,distributions1}

d <- rnorm(n = 5, mean = 10, sd = 2)
d

```

Here we are sampling 20 numbers from a binomial distribution with a size of 50 and probability of 0.5

```{r,distributions2}

b <- rbinom(n = 20, size = 50, prob = 0.5)
b
mean(b)

```

### Basic plots

Creating basic plots in R isn't very difficult.
Here are some simple ones.

Dot plot and line plot.

Adding extra lines.

Changing line colour and adding a subheading

```{r,dot1}

a <- (1:10)^2
a
plot(a)

plot(a,type="l")

plot(a,type="b")

plot(a,type="b")
lines(a/2, type="b",col="red")
mtext("Black:Growth of A. Red: growth of A/2")

```

Now for scatterplots.

We can change the point type (`pch`) and size (`cex`), as well as add a main heading (`main`).

We can also add additional series of points to the chart and adjust the axis limits with `xlim` and `ylim`.

```{r,scatter1}

x_vals <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = 2)

d_error <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 1, sd = 0.1)

y_vals <- x_vals * d_error

plot(x=x_vals, y=y_vals, xlab="my x values", ylab="my y values")

plot(x=x_vals, y=y_vals, xlab="my x values", ylab="my y values",pch=19, cex=0.5, main="Plot of X and Y values")

plot(x=x_vals, y=y_vals, xlab="my x values", ylab="my y values",pch=19, cex=0.5, main="Plot of X and Y values")
points(x=x_vals, y=y_vals/2, pch=19, cex=0.5,col="blue")

plot(x=x_vals, y=y_vals, xlab="my x values", ylab="my y values",pch=19, 
     cex=0.5, main="Plot of X and Y values",
     ylim=c(0,17))
points(x=x_vals, y=y_vals/2, pch=19, cex=0.5,col="blue")

```

Let's now run a linear regression on the relationship of y with x.

```{r,scatter2}

linear_regression_model <- lm(y_vals ~ x_vals)

summary(linear_regression_model)

SLOPE <- linear_regression_model$coefficients[1]
INTERCEPT <- linear_regression_model$coefficients[2]

HEADER <- paste("Slope:",signif(SLOPE,4),"Intercept:",signif(INTERCEPT,4))

plot(x=x_vals, y=y_vals, xlab="my x values", ylab="my y values",pch=19, cex=0.5)
abline(linear_regression_model,col="red",lty=2,lwd=3)
mtext(HEADER)

```

Barplots are also really useful.

The quantities in the vector need to have names.

```{r,barplots1}

names(a) <- 1:length(a)
barplot(a)

barplot(a,horiz = TRUE,las=1, xlab = "Measurements")

```

Boxplots are relatively easy to create.


```{r,boxplots1}

boxplot(x_vals, y_vals/2)
boxplot(x_vals, y_vals/2, names=c("X values", "Y values"),ylab="Measurement (cm)")

```

Enhanced boxplot with beeswarm.

```{r,boxplots2}

library("beeswarm")
mylist <- list("X vals"=x_vals, "Y vals"=y_vals/2)
boxplot(mylist, cex=0, ylab="Measurement (cm)",col="white",main="Main title") #cex=0 means no outliers shown
beeswarm(mylist,pch=1,add=TRUE,cex=0.5)

```

Histograms are easily made.

And it is possible to place multiple charts on a single image.

```{r,histograms1}

hist(x_vals)

par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(x_vals,main="")
hist(y_vals,main="")

```

### Part 1: Homework questions for group study

1. calculate the sum of all integers numbers between 500 and 600

2. calculate the sum of all the square roots of all integers between 900 and 1000

3. Create the following datasets and plot a boxplot:

  a. A Sample 10000 datapoints from a normal distribution with mean of 50 and SD of 5

  b. A Sample 10000 datapoints from a normal distribution with mean of 50 and SD of 10

4. Plot a and b above as a scatterplot, and plot the trend line.

5. Plot a and b above as histograms on the same chart.


## Intro to R part 2

### Data tables

So far we have only worked with 1 dimensional data, so let's get to know 2D tables.

The two most common types are data frames and matrices.
We can use `str()` to distinguish them.

```{r,datatables1}

head(freeny.x)
str(freeny.x)

head(mtcars)
str(mtcars)

```

As an example of commands that can be used for matrices and not data frames, try `mean()` for `freeny.x` and `mtcars`.

### Basic commands that can be used for data frames and matrices

Find out the number of rows, columns, and simple operations on those rows and columns.

```{r,datatables_commands}

# number of columns
ncol(mtcars)

# number of rows
nrow(mtcars)

# dimensions
dim(mtcars)

# analysing rows and columns
colMeans(freeny.x)
colSums(freeny.x)
rowMeans(freeny.x)
rowSums(freeny.x)

```


You can also transpose a matrix or data frame.
But be careful, transposing a data frame will automatically convert it to a matrix which could cause downstream errors.

```{r,transpose1}

freeny_flip <- t(freeny.x)
head(freeny_flip)

mtcars_flip <- t(mtcars)
head(mtcars_flip)
str(mtcars_flip)

mtcars_flip <- as.data.frame(mtcars_flip)
str(mtcars_flip)

```

### Subsetting a data frame

One of the most common tasks in data analysis is to perform filtering.
Last prac, we found out how to do this with vectors using the square bracket notation. Eg:`x[3]` will retrieve the 3rd element of `x`.
Square brackets can also be used for two dimensional objects, but we need to provide two indexes.
The syntax is `df[rows,cols]`.

```{r,datatables2}

# get rows 1-10 of column 2
freeny.x[1:10,2]

# get rows 1-6 of columns 1-3
freeny.x[1:6,1:3]

# get rows 1-6 of all columns
freeny.x[1:6,]

# get all rows for columns 1 and 2 
freeny.x[,1:2]

```

Now we need to see what happens when we subset just one column or row.
You can see the default behaviour is to convert the data from matrix format to a vector.
We can modify this using drop=FALSE to keep it in matrix format.

```{r,datatables3}

# get all rows of column 1
freeny.x[,1]

# to prevent conversion to vector, use drop=FALSE
freeny.x[,1,drop=FALSE]

# the same concept for rows
freeny.x[1,]

# the same concept for rows
freeny.x[1,,drop=FALSE]

```

Square brackets also works for data frames.

```{r,datatables4}

mtcars[1:10,1:6]

mtcars[,1]

mtcars[,1,drop=FALSE]

```

Data frames also have more options around subsetting columns.
For example we can subset based on the name of the column or row.

```{r,datatables5}

mtcars[,"cyl"]

mtcars[,c("mpg","wt")]

mtcars["Camaro Z28",c("mpg","wt")]

```

Data frames columns can also be subsetted using the `$` notation.
The syntax is `df$col`.

```{r,datatables6}

mtcars$mpg

```

This type of notation can even be used to create new columns.
In this example below, we are converting the miles per gallon value to liters per 100km unit.
We are also rounding this value to three significant figures.

```{r,datatables7}

mtcars$lper100km <- 235.215 / mtcars$mpg

mtcars[,c(1,ncol(mtcars))]

mtcars$lper100km <- signif(235.215 / mtcars$mpg ,3)

mtcars[,c(1,ncol(mtcars))]

```


You may also want to subset a data frame based on the values.
Let's say you want a car with fuel consumption less than 10 L/100km.
Let's do it the hard way first.

```{r, subsetting1}

mtcars$lper100km 
mtcars$lper100km < 10
which(mtcars$lper100km < 10)
mtcars[which(mtcars$lper100km < 10),]

```

You can see that this is quite complicated.
There is an easier way using `subset()`.
Subset is also perfect for filtering based on more than one criteria using the `&` and '|' operators.

```{r, subsetting2}
mtcars
subset(mtcars,lper100km < 10)

# you want an economical AND quick car
subset(mtcars,lper100km < 10 & qsec < 18)

# you want an economical OR quick car
subset(mtcars,lper100km < 10 | qsec < 18)

```

Subset also works for strings and factors.
To look at this we need to look at the `iris` dataset

```{r, subsetting3}

head(iris)
str(iris)

setosa <- subset(iris,Species == "setosa")
head(setosa)

```

### Row and columns names

You can use the `colnames` and `rownames` to get the row or column names and even mofidy them.

```{r,rowcolnames1}

colnames(mtcars)

rownames(mtcars)

colnames(mtcars) <- c("miles per gallon",
              "number of cylinders",
              "displacement in cubic inches",
              "gross horsepower",
              "rear axle ratio",
              "weight (pounds/1000)",
              "quarter mile time in seconds",
              "V or straight cylinder configuration",
              "transmission type: auto (0) or manual (1)",
              "number of forward gears",
              "number of carburetors",
              "litres per 100km")

head(mtcars)

colnames(mtcars)[1] <- "miles per US gallon"

head(mtcars)

```

If you have a whitespace in the column or row name, it might cause problems later on with subsetting. 
In that case the column name needs to be wrapped in backticks like this.

```{r, subsetting4}

economical_cars <- subset(mtcars,`litres per 100km` < 10)

economical_cars

```

It is also useful to be able to subset a data frame based on the row names.
Let's get all the Mercedes models.
To do this, we need to introduce the `grep()` command which matches strings.

```{r,rowcolnames2}

# let's look again at the car names
rownames(mtcars)

# lets filter all the ones with "Merc in the name"
grep("Merc",rownames(mtcars))

# now lets extract out all those rows
mercs <- mtcars[grep("Merc",rownames(mtcars)),]

mercs

```

### Sorting data tables

We are going to sort our subset of economical cars by their speed based on their quarter mile time.
To do this, we need to use the `order()` command together with the square brackets.
`order()` only returns the index of the values, it doesn't actually do the sorting.
Note that `order()` default behaviour is to bring the smaller values to the top.
That can be reversed by putting a `-` before the vector being ordered.

```{r,sorting1}

economical_cars

order(economical_cars$`quarter mile time in seconds`)

sorted <- economical_cars[order(economical_cars$`quarter mile time in seconds`),]

sorted[,c(7,ncol(sorted))]

reverse_sorted <- economical_cars[order(-economical_cars$`quarter mile time in seconds`),]

reverse_sorted[,c(7,ncol(reverse_sorted))]

```

### Creating data frames and matrices

First we will create a data frame for some people who completed a survey about their height and weight.
You should always run `str()` to check that the resulting dataframe has the intended structure.
You may need to include `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to protect character strings being converted to factors.

```{r,create_df1}

pnames <- c("Jill", "Matt", "Sam", "Amy", "Bob", "Raj")

pnames

pgender <- as.factor(c("F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M"))

pgender

pheight <- c(164, 186, 170, 175, 178, 191)

pheight

pweight <- c(54.1, 90.3, 64.8, 66.7, 80.4, 86.9)

pweight

df <- data.frame(pnames,pgender,pheight,pweight)

str(df)

df <- data.frame(pnames,pgender,pheight,pweight,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

str(df)

df

```

Now we might want to make the row names the name of the person.
This makes the data tidier, but it won't work if there are more then one entry with the same name.
You can use the `NULL` to delete columns.
Deleting rows can be done with square brackets.

```{r,create_df2}

rownames(df) <- df$pnames

df

df$pnames=NULL

df

# delete row 2 and 4
df <- df[-c(2,4),]

```

Now we will convert df into a matrix.

```{r,create_mat1}

as.matrix(df)

df$pgender <- as.numeric(df$pgender)

mymat <- as.matrix(df)

mymat
str(mymat)

```

We can also convert other types of data into a matrix.
To demonstrate this, I'll create some random data with `rnorm` and convert it into a matrix.

```{r,create_mat2}

mydata <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 20)

mymatrix <- matrix(data = mydata, nrow = 20, ncol = 5)

mymatrix

```

### Creating charts from data frame and matrix objects

Making charts from data frames and matrix objects is really similar to what we did above.
Here are some examples.

```{r,plots1,fig.height=8,fig.width=8}

# histogram of cylinders
data(mtcars)
hist(mtcars$cyl,xlab="number of cylinders", main="number of cylinders in mtcars data")

# boxplot of qsec values for Toyota and Mercedes
toyota <- mtcars[grep("Toyota",rownames(mtcars)),]
merc <- mtcars[grep("Merc",rownames(mtcars)),]
boxplot(toyota$qsec, merc$qsec,
        ylab="quarter mile time in seconds",
        main="mtcars",
        names = c("Toyota","Mercedes"))

# scatterplot of petal length vs sepal length for setosa irises
# include a trend line using the lm function
setosa <- subset(iris,Species=="setosa")
head(setosa)
mylm <- lm(setosa$Sepal.Length ~ setosa$Petal.Length)
plot(setosa$Petal.Length,setosa$Sepal.Length,
     xlab="Petal length (cm)",
     ylab="Sepal length (cm)",
     main="Setosa petal and sepal length",
     pch=19)
abline(mylm,col="red",lwd=2,lty=2)

# a pairs plot is a special type of scatterplot
pairs(mymatrix)

# lets make a line diagram of freeny revenues
# first need to normalise each column to the initial value
head(freeny.x)
freeny_norm <-t( t(freeny.x) / freeny.x[1,] )
head(freeny_norm)

plot(freeny_norm[,1], type="b", ylim=c(0.9,1.12), col="blue",
     xlab="Quarters beginning 1962 Q2",
     ylab="Change in values overtime")
  lines(freeny_norm[,2], type="b", col="red")
  lines(freeny_norm[,3], type="b", col="black")
  lines(freeny_norm[,4], type="b", col="darkgreen")
legend("topleft", legend = colnames(freeny.x), lty=1 , col = c("blue","red", "black", "darkgreen"))

```

In R, sometimes we need to load a particular package in order to make a special type of chart.
In the example below we are making a heatmap, where the colour indicates the numerical value.

```{r,heatmaps,fig.height=8,fig.width=8  }

library("gplots")
heatmap.2(mymatrix,trace="none",scale="none",main="heatmap")
heatmap.2(cor(mymatrix),trace="none",scale="none", main="correlation")

```

This is also a good time to let you know that you can save R charts as files.
There are different types of file formats, but PNG and PDF are the most used types.
You will see these new files appear in your files menu.

```{r,output_plots}

pdf("myplot.pdf")
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

png("myplot.png")
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

```

### Part 2: Homework questions for group study

1. Create a scatterplot of mtcars weight (x axis) versus mpg (y axis). 
Include x and y axis labels and a main heading.

2. Sort mtcars by weight (wt) and create a horizontal barplot of wt values so heaviest ones at shown at the top of the bar plot.
The plot should be labeled so it is clear to see which bar belong to which car.
Include an axis label and main title.

3. Create a box plot of iris petal lengths.

## Intro to R part 3

### Dealing with read data

So far we have been working with datasets that are built into R, but in the real world you will be working with data files.
These could be in different formats like text (.txt), comma separated values (.csv), tab separated values (.tsv) and perhaps Excel files too (.xls and .xlsx).

We will be working with TSV file of pipetting measurements.
URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/bioinformatics_intro_workshop/refs/heads/main/data/my.tsv

We will use the `read.table()` command and show you some really important options.

```{r,tsv}

URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/bioinformatics_intro_workshop/refs/heads/main/data/my.tsv"

download.file(URL,"my.tsv")
# look closely at the structure of pip
# can you see what is wrong?
pip <- read.table("my.tsv")
pip
str(pip)

# try again
pip <- read.table(URL,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pip
str(pip)

# try again
# looking better
pip <- read.table(URL,stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header=TRUE)
pip
str(pip)

# got it now
pip <- read.table(URL,stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header=TRUE, row.names=1)
pip
str(pip)

```

Now let's try a csv file containing some travel records.

```{r,readcsv}

URL="https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/airtravel.csv"

trav <- read.table(URL,sep=",")
trav
str(trav)

trav <- read.table(URL,sep=",",header=TRUE)
trav
str(trav)

trav <- read.csv(URL)
trav
str(trav)

```

Now let's try a Microsoft Excel file.

```{r,readxl}

URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/bioinformatics_intro_workshop/refs/heads/main/data/file_example_XLS_10.xls"
NAME="file_example_XLS_10.xls"
download.file(URL,destfile=NAME)
library("readxl")

mydata <- read_xls(NAME)
mydata
str(mydata)

```

### Save and load session and single datasets

When working in R, it is convenient to save the session with `save.image()`.
This results in an Rdata file which contains all the data objects in your current environment.
To test that it's actually working, clear your environment with the sweep/broom icon and then load the Rdata file with `load()`.

```{r,save1}

save.image("mysession.Rdata")

rm(list=ls())

load("mysession.Rdata")

```

That is really cool, but sometimes we want to save individual objects, such as a large dataframe as Rdata files.

```{r,save2}

saveRDS(object = mymatrix , file = "mymatrix.Rds")

rm(list=ls())

x <- readRDS("mymatrix.Rds")

head(x)

```

### Part 3: Check your skills

For the TSV file located here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/bioinformatics_intro_workshop/refs/heads/main/data/mydata.tsv

1. Read it in and show the first 6 rows of data.

2. Calculate the column and row means.

3. Use the `cor()` command to find the correlation coefficients between the 3 data sets. Which two datasets are the most similar?

4. Make a pairs plot of the three datasets.

5. Save the script. Clear the environment and execute it to confirm that it is working.

## Session information

For reproducibility.

```{r,sessioninfo}

sessionInfo()

```
